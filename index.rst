Freya Documentation
===================

Welcome to the documentation for `Freya <http://freya.io>`_, a functional web programming stack for F#. The documentation is organic and we happily accept pull requests for changes, additions and improvements to the documentation -- as well as to Freya itself.

If there's content you'd like to see and which doesn't appear to be referenced (even as a placeholder) please raise an issue `here <https://github.com/freya-fs/freya.documentation/issues>`_ and we'll do our best.
