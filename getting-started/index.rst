Getting Started
===============

Hopefully you're convinced by now that having a go with Freya would be a good idea. The best thing to do is grab the latest release and start playing. You can start by creating a new or existing web or console application. Since Freya is a stack and not a framework, Freya will play nicely with existing applications. The rest of the documentation will help you along the way. Make sure you've got a working :doc:`/getting-started/installation`, before having a look at some of our :doc:`/tutorials/index`.

If you'd prefer to dive straight in to the framework references, start with :doc:`/core/index` -- hopefully there should be enough discussion and explanation inline to make that a good route to learning, too.
