Concepts
========

Freya doesn't require exhaustive knowledge of web technology or standards or functional programming, but there are some concepts which will help in understanding where Freya fits in to the world, and how to get the most from it.

Understanding at least a little about the OWIN standard will help you know what's going on under the hood, and will be useful with other approaches to .NET web programming as well.

It'll also be handy to understand why Freya is structured the way it is when you decide to start creating your own abstractions on top of Freya.
