Contributing to Freya
=====================

We welcome contributions to Freya, and we're committed to making the process of contributing to Freya simple, straightforward, and, above all, friendly.

Documentation
-------------

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, the quickest way is to use the "Edit on GitHub" link at the top of any page -- that'll allow you to edit any content and send us a pull request easily. Alternatively, see the Contact section below.

Code
----

As with documentation, the quickest way to contribute is to fork on GitHub, but feel free to reach out first and chat if you'd like to get a feel for good things to work on (if you don't already have plans). If you'd like to speak first, see the Contact section below.

Contact
-------
