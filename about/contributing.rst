Contributing to Freya
=====================

We welcome contributions to Freya, and we're committed to making the process
of contributing to Freya simple, straightforward, and, above all, friendly.

Documentation
-------------

If you'd like to contribute to the documentation, the quickest way is to use
the "Edit on GitHub" link at the top of any page -- that'll allow you to edit
any content and send us a pull request easily. Alternatively, see the Contact
section below.

Code
----

As with documentation, the quickest way to contribute is to create a fork on GitHub
and submit a pull request. We also welcome you to log
`issues <https://github.com/freya-fs/freya/issues>`_ to let us know of something
that is broken or that you would like to see added. If you are looking for a way
to contribute, the issues list is definitely a good place to start. Feel free to
reach out and chat if you'd like to get a feel for our priorities. See the Contact
section below for ways to reach us.
