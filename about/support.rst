Support
=======

Freya is an open source project, and we don't get paid for working on it.
We currently handle support through
`GitHub Issues <https://github.com/freya-fs/freya/issues>`_,
and also through our `Gitter Channel <https://gitter.im/freya-fs/freya>`_.
We're friendly and will try and help in any way we can (within reason).

.. note::

   Companies who wish to obtain additional support to implement Freya in a project are welcome to contact us to discuss the possibility of an appropriate level of commercial support/advice if desired.
