Types and Lenses
================

Freya uses lenses to provide access to various aspects of the request and response state (as well as other data which may be generated as part of processing, such as route data). The lenses provide map the underlying data to and from typed representations, which use the :doc:`/types-and-lenses/arachne` project.
